# Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am Kevin Kandlbinder, a developer and hobby photographer from northern germany.
I've learnt working with computers at an early age, when I took over the old family PC.
Some years later I've had my first contact with web development a few years later when I bought a book about HTML, PHP, JavaScript and CSS from a sale at my local library.
From this point onwards web development has been a job and a hobby equally.
